# Python Structured Data 2 Practice

In this practice, you will write Python code to make a series of unit tests
pass.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change directory into the repository.
3. Make sure you are running a version of Python 3.8.
4. Install the `Pipfile` by running `pipenv install`.
5. Run `pytest` to run the tests.

## Usage

1. **Manually test by running the file (for example, `python problem_01_builtin.py`)**.
   Before you run all the unit tests, use manual testing to compare your result
   with the expected result commented next to the print statements.
2. **Run the tests by typing `pytest`**.
3. Your objective is to implement the code in each of the following Python
   modules so that when you run `pytest`, all tests pass. A green dot (.) next
   to the tests means that it passed a test.

## Submitting your project

1. There are two `__pycache__` directories, one in the root of your project and
   one in the `test` subdirectory. Delete both of those `__pycache__`
   directories.
2. ZIP your project directory.
3. Submit it using the submit button.
